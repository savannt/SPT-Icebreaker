    // HYBRID BAKE — retail cover data everywhere, our generated data in named zones only.
    //
    // WHY THIS NEEDED INVENTING RATHER THAN CONFIGURING. the obvious question was whether the
    // bake is already split per zone so we could just pick a source per zone. it is not:
    //
    //   AICoversData.Points   ONE flat List<GroupPoint> for the entire map
    //   GroupPoint            carries NO BotZone reference (grepped the decompile — zero)
    //   AICorePointsHolder    global, likewise
    //   AIVoxelesData         a world-space grid; cover lookup is spatial, never by zone
    //   BotZone.PatrolWays    the ONE genuinely per-zone thing in the whole bake
    //
    // so cover selection has no zone dimension to switch on. the partition has to be one we
    // define geometrically, which is what ZoneRegion below is.
    //
    // the shape of the problem this exists for: on the RETAIL bake the helipad squad takes
    // its proper cover spots but bots park in the freezer; on the FULLY generated bake the
    // freezer clears and the helipad squad stands in the open instead. neither set is good
    // everywhere, and the two failures are in different places, so per-zone sourcing is a
    // real experiment rather than a guess.
    //
    // SEAM CAVEAT, stated up front because it is a genuine limitation and not a bug to chase
    // later: generated ways only survive when BOTH endpoints are inside the region, so there
    // are no cover-to-cover links crossing a region border. a bot can walk across the seam
    // normally (that is navmesh, untouched) but it will not chain a cover hop from a synth
    // point directly to a retail one. keeping the regions bigger than the firefights inside
    // them is what keeps that from mattering.

        // roster that was hopeless: these compartments sit 10-13m apart, so a disc sized to
        // cover the galley also swallowed RoomsThird, Room_Eng, Room_Eng2 and Mash_t1. five
        // requested zones carved 764 of 1885 retail points — ten zones' worth of ship.

        // no single radius fixes that, because the right radius differs per zone. so drop the
        // radius idea: a point belongs to whichever zone centre is NEAREST, and we rebuild it
        // only if that zone was named. the partition is then bounded by the neighbours
