    //      checks EPlayerItems.Equipment — carried gear, not stash)
    //   2. the fare is CONSUMED at raid creation, before anything loads
    //      (labs does this in BaseLocalGame pre-spawn via a local grid removal; ours
    //      runs in LocalGame.smethod_6, the factory that receives the Profile, which
    //      is the same point of no return one call earlier)
    // the removal is deliberately LOCAL, no network transaction — identical to the
    // labs keycard, whose removal persists through the raid-end inventory sync.
    //
    // transit arrivals are exempt: the hovercraft already charged the same fare
    // in-raid at the point of boarding, and one crossing must not bill twice.
